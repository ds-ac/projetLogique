(** Variables (i.e. propositional constants) are represented by positive
	* integers. Literals are arbitrary integers: for any variable X coded
	* as a positive integer [n], the positive literal X is represented by
	* [n]Â and not(X) is represented by [-n].
	*
	* A partial assignment [m] is a matrix of size [2 x (n+1)] of booleans where n
	* is the number of variables to be assgned in the SAT problem. The first line
	* represents whether a litteral has already been assigned or not, and the
	* second line represents the value of assigned litterals.
	*
	* e.g. if [(0, 5)] and [(1, 5)] are both set to [true], it means that at this
	* point of the execution, the litteral represented by the integer 5 is
	* assigned to [true], but if [(0, 5)] is [false], then it is not assigned,
	* whatever the value of [(1, 5)] is.
	*
	*
	*
	* The stack represents changes made by each successive calls of dpll in the
	* current branch of the assignment tree.
	* Before the execution of the main call, the stack is empty.
	* Before each recursive call, 0 is added on the stack. As this value does not
	* represent any litteral, it does not mean anything in the stack.
	* If the dpll function does not raise SAT, and stops, every alternate value is
	* set back to unassigned and the stack returns to its origilan form. In such a
	* case, there is no need to add 0 to the stack again as there is no more
	* possible values to try for the current litteral.
